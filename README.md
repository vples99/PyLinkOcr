# PyLinkOcr
"An image is worth a thousand words", but sometimes the thousands of words you want are hidden behind the link in the image. This small project came to be after I wanted to access a link in a screenshot but didn't want to type it all out, so I thought, why not make my own small link ocr (optical character recognition) as a way to improve my python skills and get started with image processing and manipulation that will be useful for some data related projects down the line.

## Tools and libraries
Python 3 as a base for the code.
Tesseract for image processing tasks.
Pillow for extracting the image from the user's clipboard.
